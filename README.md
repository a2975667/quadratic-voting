# About
This is an prototype of quadratic voting, as inspired by <a href='http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9512322/humans-are-doing-democracy-wrong-bees-are-doing-it-right/'>this article on bees</a> and <a href='http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/'>Eric Posner's proposal</a>.

It allows you to vote for dinner. Each voter receives the same number of tokens to vote with. You can vote for a single item more than once, but the cost of a vote increases exponentially.

In contrast with Poser's proposal, this prototype takes the opinion that each person should have the same number of tokens, rather than allowing votes to be paid for in cash.
