<p>This is an prototype of quadratic voting, as inspired by <a href='http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/9512322/humans-are-doing-democracy-wrong-bees-are-doing-it-right/'>this article on bees</a> and <a href='http://ericposner.com/quadratic-voting/'>Eric Posner&#8217;s proposal</a>.</p>

<p>It allows you to vote for dinner. Each voter receives the same number of tokens to vote with. You can vote for a single item more than once, but the cost of a vote increases exponentially.</p>

<p>In contrast with Poser&#8217;s proposal, this prototype takes the opinion that each person should have the same number of tokens, rather than allowing votes to be paid for in cash.</p>
